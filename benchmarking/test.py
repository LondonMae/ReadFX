text = "It is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history.[14] Pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.[14] In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today[109] to describe exclusion from the group implies a distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, childrens playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dogs role, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.[111][page needed] People and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each others lives[112][page needed] to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a family and home are experienced.[113] There have been two significant trends occurring within the second half of the 20th century in pet dogs changing status. The first has been commodification, shaping it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior.[113] The second has been the broadening of the familys concept and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[113]A vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[114] The list of goods, services, and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries.[114] Dog training books, classes, and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.[115] The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack.[113] Some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer, have promoted a dominance model of dog-human relationships. However, it has been disputed that trying to achieve status is characteristic of dog-human interactions.[116] The idea of the alpha dog trying to be dominant is based on a disproved theory about wolf packs.[117][118] Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog; to mediate their interactions with each other.[119] Increasingly, human family-members engage in activities centered on the dogs perceived needs and interests, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.[114] According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009â€“2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs.[120] The same source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any sex preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of male and female pet dogs. Although several programs promote pet adoption, less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters. A study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare humans and dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to recognize human emotional sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans."
